#### 1. The password of `Level09` is the token that got from `Level08`.

```bash
wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
```

#### 2. So, try login to Level09 with the password we got from Level08 and try to put the command `ls`. We can see the files `Level09` and `token`. and try to `cat` and `execute` as we did in previous exercises.

```bash
flag08@SnowCrash:~$ su level09
Password:
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la
total 24
dr-x------ 1 level09 level09  140 Mar  5  2016 .
d--x--x--x 1 root    users    340 Aug 30  2015 ..
-r-x------ 1 level09 level09  220 Apr  3  2012 .bash_logout
-r-x------ 1 level09 level09 3518 Aug 30  2015 .bashrc
-r-x------ 1 level09 level09  675 Apr  3  2012 .profile
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag09  level09 7640 Mar  5  2016 level09
----r--r-- 1 flag09  level09   26 Mar  5  2016 token
level09@SnowCrash:~$ cat token
f4kmm6p|=�p�n��DB�Du{��
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09
You need to provied only one arg.
```

#### 3. Execute ltrace with level09 file.

```bash
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ltrace ./level09
__libc_start_main(0x80487ce, 1, 0xbffff7a4, 0x8048aa0, 0x8048b10 <unfinished ...>
ptrace(0, 0, 1, 0, 0xb7e2fe38)                    = -1
puts("You should not reverse this"You should not reverse this
)               = 28
+++ exited (status 1) +++
```
#### 4. Execute ./level09 with token

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 token
tpmhr
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 1
1
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 12
13
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 123
135
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 1234
1357
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 12345
13579
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 a
a
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 ab
ac
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 abc
ace
level09@SnowCrash:~$ ./level09 aaaaaa
abcdef
```

I put different value after the ./level09 and seems like there's a pattern. When I executed the string character, I got the result as below. Same logic for the same character of string.

```
input: abcd

a - index 0, ascii + 0, output a
b - index 1, ascii + 1, output c
c - index 2, ascii + 2, output e
d - index 3, ascii + 3, output g


output: acegi
```
```
1 - index 0, ascii + 0, output 1
2 - index 1, ascii + 1, output 3
3 - index 2, ascii + 2, output 5
4 - index 3, ascii + 3, output 7
// the index value has been added for each char.
```

Each character in the input string is transformed based on its position in the string, and the transformed result is printed.

#### 5. So, all we have to do is to create the code to transforme it. This function transforms a given string by subtracting an index value from each character's ASCII value and then prints the result. 


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	char *flag;
	int i;

	if(argc != 2)
	{
		printf("Only one argument, please \n");
		return 1;
	}

	flag = argv[1];
  i = 0;
	while(*flag)
	{
		printf("%c", *flag - i);
		i++;
		flag++;
	}
	printf("\n");
	return 0;
}
```

This is the program written by C to transforme the characters.


How to use ? Try to compile inside the tmp directory to avoid the permission denied issues.

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ cd /tmp
level09@SnowCrash:/tmp$ vi flag.c
level09@SnowCrash:/tmp$ gcc flag.c -o flag
level09@SnowCrash:/tmp$ cd ~
level09@SnowCrash:~$ cat token | xargs /tmp/flag
f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq
```
This command performs a transformation on the content of the file named "token" using a custom program located at "/tmp/flag". Let's break it down:

* `cat token`: This command reads the content of the file named "token" and outputs it to the standard output.

* `|`: This symbol is called a pipe and it is used to pass the output of one command as the input to another command.

* `xargs /tmp/flag`: This command takes each line of input from the previous command (the content of "token") and passes it as an argument to the program located at "/tmp/flag".



So, in summary, this command reads the content of the file "token", passes each line of content as an argument to the program "/tmp/flag", and performs some transformation on it. 

#### 6. So, we found our password! Let's put our password into flag08 for level09.

```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ cat token | xargs /tmp/flag
f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq
```
#### 7. finally, we got a token for level10
```
level09@SnowCrash:~$ su flag09
Password:
Don't forget to launch getflag !
flag09@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : s5cAJpM8ev6XHw998pRWG728z
```
