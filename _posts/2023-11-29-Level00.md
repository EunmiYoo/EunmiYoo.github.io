#### 1. First, connect to ssh with your ip address :

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub level00@165.22.17.96 -p 4242
```
you will see...

```
   _____                      _____               _
  / ____|                    / ____|             | |
 | (___  _ __   _____      _| |     _ __ __ _ ___| |__

  Good luck & Have fun

          46.101.129.15 10.114.0.2
level00@206.189.251.157's password:
```
#### 2.  you will be able to register using the following couple of login:password: level00:level00.

Then, try to put the command 'ls' or 'ls -la' to look inside the file.

```
level00@206.189.251.157's password:
level00@SnowCrash:~$ ls
level00@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la
total 12
dr-xr-x---+ 1 level00 level00 100 Mar 5 2016 .
d--x--x--x 1 root users 340 Aug 30 2015 ..
-r-xr-x---+ 1 level00 level00 220 Apr 3 2012 .bash_logout
-r-xr-x---+ 1 level00 level00 3518 Aug 30 2015 .bashrc
-r-xr-x---+ 1 level00 level00 675 Apr 3 2012 .profile
```
#### 3. Nothing can be found with 'ls' or 'ls -la'

Once registered, you’re gonna have to find the password that will log you in with the "flagXX" account(XX = current level number).
```
level00@SnowCrash:~$ su flag00
Password:
su: Authentication failure
level00@SnowCrash:~$
```
#### 4. So, we need to find the account who use flag00 (written in the subject). So, try to put the command as below to find the flag00 in the file type.

`find / -type f -user flag00`


 1. find / : Starts the search from the root directory. This search will include all directories and subdirecotires

 2. -user flag00 : Specifices the search criterion. It looks for files owned by the user with the username "flag00"

 3. -exec ls -l {} \;: Executes the ls -l command on each file found. The {} is a placeholder for the current file, and \; signifies the end of the -exec command.

 4. 2>/dev/null: Redirects standard error (file descriptor 2) to /dev/null, effectively discarding error messages. This is done to suppress error messages related to inaccessible directories or files due to permission issues.



#### 5. There are only 2 file paths which doesn't show "Permission denied" among the many resulting files.

`/usr/sbin/john`

`/rofs/usr/sbin/john`

```
....
....
/tmp': Permission denied
/usr/sbin/john
find: `/var/cache/ldconfig': Permission denied
find: `/var/lib/php5': Permission denied
find: `/var/lib/sudo': Permission denied
find: `/var/spool/cron/atjobs': Permission denied
find: `/var/spool/cron/atspool': Permission denied
find: `/var/spool/cron/crontabs': Permission denied
find: `/var/tmp': Permission denied
find: `/var/www/level04': Permission denied
find: `/var/www/level12': Permission denied
find: `/rofs/etc/chatscripts': Permission denied
find: `/rofs/etc/ppp/peers': Permission denied
find: `/rofs/etc/ssl/private': Permission denied
find: `/rofs/home': Permission denied
find: `/rofs/root': Permission denied
/rofs/usr/sbin/john
find: `/rofs/var/cache/ldconfig': Permission denied
find: `/rofs/var/lib/php5': Permission denied.
...
...
```
#### 6. They possess the same password as cdiiddwpgswtgt

```
level00@SnowCrash:~$ cat /usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt
level00@SnowCrash:~$ cat /rofs/usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt
level00@SnowCrash:~$
```

#### 7. But, it was NOT the correct password. We can possibly think, maybe this password is encyrpted? in this case, we need to decrypt them.

ROT 13?

Letter substitution cipher
ROT are short for Rotate
Each letter in alphabet has a numeric position(1-26)
A = position 1
B = position 2
Z = position 26 (last position)
Rotate : Replaces each word with the 13th letter after it
After position(p) greater than 26, letters reset to p-26
ROT13 Reverse Translation

Alphabet position -13
if this value is negative, then substract the absolute value of it from 26
This is the new position

So I tried to use the first decrypted result (ROT 15), so that's how we got the result(password) for get the token Level01!

`nottoohardhere`

#### 8. Voila ! with getflag command, we got a token for next level01!
```
level00@SnowCrash:~$ su flag00
Password:
Don't forget to launch getflag !
flag00@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
flag00@SnowCrash:~$
```
